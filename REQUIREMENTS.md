# Weather Application Requirements

## Overview
A React-based weather application that provides detailed weather information based on location with advanced search and filtering capabilities.

## Core Features

### 1. Location-based Weather Display
- Auto-detect user's current location on initial load
- Display current weather information including:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed and direction
  - Weather condition (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.)
  - Precipitation probability
  - UV index
  - Visibility
  - Air pressure

### 2. Location Search
- Search bar to enter any location
- Auto-suggestions for location search
- Search history preservation
- Error handling for invalid locations

### 3. Extended Forecast
- 7-day weather forecast
- Daily weather information including:
  - High and low temperatures
  - Precipitation probability
  - Weather condition
  - Wind speed
- Hourly breakdown for each day

### 4. Date-based Filtering
- Calendar component for date selection
- Default to current date
- Ability to view historical weather data
- Date range selection for comparative analysis

## Technical Requirements

### API Integration
- Weather API (suggested: OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI)
- Geolocation API for user location detection
- Places API for location search suggestions

### State Management
- React Context API for global state management
- Local storage for search history and preferences

### Type Safety
- TypeScript implementation
- Proper type definitions for API responses
- Interface definitions for components

### Component Structure
I want to create weather application in react the application is Show the weather information as well as other relative information taken from any api and also the application so search bar in which we can enter the location and the location will fetch the entire weather information of that location and also there is an option to show 7 day data of that location and we can also filter the data based on the date also there will be by default selection of date based on the user's location. Help me create the context markdown file for developers to understand the application requirement.

typescript
// Suggested component hierarchy
interface AppStructure {
App: {
Header: {
SearchBar: {
LocationInput: null;
AutoSuggestions: null;
};
};
WeatherDisplay: {
CurrentWeather: null;
WeatherDetails: null;
ForecastSection: {
DaySelector: null;
HourlyBreakdown: null;
};
};
DateFilter: {
Calendar: null;
RangeSelector: null;
};
};
}


## User Experience Requirements

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints for tablet and desktop
- Smooth transitions between views

### Loading States
- Skeleton loaders during API calls
- Smooth transitions for data updates
- Error states with user-friendly messages

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance

## Performance Considerations
- API response caching
- Debounced search
- Lazy loading for extended forecast data
- Image optimization for weather icons
- Progressive loading for historical data

## Error Handling
- Network error handling
- Location access denial handling
- Invalid location input handling
- API rate limit handling

## Future Enhancements
- Weather alerts and notifications
- Multiple location saving
- Weather maps integration
- Dark/Light theme toggle
- Unit conversion (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
- Weather data visualization
- Share weather information
